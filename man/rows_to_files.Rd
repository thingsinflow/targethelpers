\title{Convert the rows of a data frame to individual files}
\usage{
rows_to_files(
  data_df,
  cols_not_to_compare = c(),
  id_col_name = "id",
  path = "data_in",
  file_prefix = "item",
  extension = ".qs2"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_df}{A data frame containing the rows to be written as separate
files.}

\item{cols_not_to_compare}{Character vector of column names that should be
ignored when determining if a row has changed (e.g. automatically updated
timestamps).  Defaults to none.}

\item{id_col_name}{Name of the column that uniquely identifies each row; used
for file naming and comparison. Defaults to "id".}

\item{path}{Directory where the files will be written; created if it does not
exist. Defaults to "data_in".}

\item{file_prefix}{Prefix added to each generated file name.  Defaults to
"item".}

\item{extension}{File extension (including leading dot) used when saving
files. Defaults to ".qs2".}
}
\value{
A list with five components that summarises the actions taken:
\describe{
\item{data_df_w_filepaths}{Data frame augmented with the full path of each row’s file.}
\item{ids_new_or_changed_rows}{Vector of ids for rows that are new or have changed.}
\item{changes}{Data frame with summary of what has changed. Each row lists \code{id}, \code{changed_cols}, \code{old}, \code{new}, with \code{old} and \code{new} encoded as JSON.}
\item{new_or_updated_files}{Character vector of paths to files that were created or updated.}
\item{deleted_files}{Character vector of paths to files that were removed because the row is no longer present.}
}
}
\description{
Writes each row of a data frame as a separate file, updates changed rows, and
removes files for rows that are no longer present. Useful as input for
monitoring input files in a Targets pipeline.
}
\details{
The function creates a directory if needed, compares existing files
to the current data (ignoring specified columns), writes new or updated
rows, deletes obsolete files, and returns a summary of actions taken.

# Example usage
df <- data.frame(id = 1:3, value = c("a", "b", "c"))
