Description: Miscellaneous helper functions for building pipelines using the 
    'Targets'/'Tarchetypes' packages. Currently only a few functions are implemented 
    for converting data frame rows to individual files, while syncing changes by 
    updating only modified rows and cleaning up obsolete files. Useful when 
    scraping webdata where a local persisted copy of the previous version of the 
    data is needed in order to determine if the data has changed since the previous 
    run.
